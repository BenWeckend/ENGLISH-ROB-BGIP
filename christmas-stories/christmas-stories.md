# Some christmas stories using technical language from BGIP and ROB

## The big crash 💥☄️

Written by Lili, Samuel and Sophie

<br>

We all know Santa; old man, white beard and a red coat. But at some point in our life we realized that Santa doesn’t bring our presents. Instead it’s our parents and the Amazon delivery guy. But what would you think, if we told you that Santa is indeed real and alive, but he lost his Christmas license. Let us tell you the whole story….

We start round about 65 million years ago. Even back then Santa surprised all the living beings on Christmas Eve. So as always he was very busy bringing presents to all the dinosaurs. He only had a few more hours left till sunrise and still millions of dinosaurs left to visit. He was extremely stressed and flew way too fast, although that violates paragraph 14 of the RSFL (Reindeer Sleigh Flying Law). While flying over Scandinavia, Santa was blinded by the polar lights caused by the solar wind. Because of that, he lost control of his heavy sleigh (imagine that there were 30 billion dinosaurs on the earth back then and each of them wanted a Lego Set weighing about 1 kg; that would make the total mass of the sleigh about 30 million tons ignoring the remarkable mass of Santa Claus and the sleigh itself). The vehicle came spinning down and crashed in to the folded mountain range with a speed of 22 000 kilometers per hour. The impact was comparable with a meteorite with a diameter of 24 kilometers after passing through the upper atmosphere. This accident had a massive effect on the climate of the earth causing a mass extinction of many species. However, somehow Santa survived (sadly, all the reindeer died 😭) but lost his reindeer sleigh license as a punishment (He was lucky, because the death sentence didn’t exist back then). But there were positive effects of the destruction too; after the impact beautiful minerals were formed in the melt of the crater. And since then humans can enjoy the diversity of 5 thousand minerals.

## SANTA AND THE SEISMIC WAVES 

On Christmas Day  Larry, Barry and Terry sat in the University at their desk and evaluated data from seismographs as every day, when something unimaginable happened. Suddenly this day was far away from a usual Christmas. Every red light in their rooms came on and sirens started blasting. 

Larry looked shocked to the others: „Did your seismograph also just go off the charts?“ Barry and Terry confirmed with shocked faces. In minutes they tried to locate where the seismic waves came from and instantly hopped in their trucks and travelled to the epicenter… 

<br>

If however they could travel to the epicenter. Everything in their path was blocked by debris, burnt trees and dirt piles. After some time, they managed to get through it on their feet, only to see sugar canes and wrapped presents sprinkled over the crate. Suddenly Terry spoke up: „ Everything just … reminds me of a same case, which happened 65 million years ago, you guys remember how the dinosaurs went extinct?“ „Didn’t archeologists find fossils of sugar canes just like these ones at the former impact crater?“ replied Barry. 

They decided to look into the crater only to make a SHOCKING discovery:
There was a individual clad in a red coat and a big white beard, which had quite some burned parts.

Not only that, but the person was sitting at around 40 kilometers of depth. 
„Oh my god, he punched right through the continental crust consisting of felsic-rich material?!” Larry shouted.

With their new experiences acquired, they reported back to the University. If they looked back, they could have seen the person flying out of the crater with a sleigh.

<br>

Epilogue:

On the night of the 24th of December, seismic waves just like this one would be picked up all over the world, with new craters getting created everywhere. For some reason,  this wasn’t the “big extinction 2.0”, but instead kids all over the world got into the craters and picked up sugar canes and presents.

This mysterious event was later attributed to the “Christmas Spirit”.

## A Robots christmas story

Written by DerPfadlose, Kerbaltec Solutions and ChatGPT

<br>

Little Jhonny was visiting his Grandfather, Steve, on christmas eve and as it was tradition, the old man was sitting in his armchair telling christmas stories. But something was different this year. Jhonnys grandfather used a freely available artificial intelligence, an neural network, to automate the process of coming up with Stories.

Whenenever Jhonny came up with a prompt, the old man would type it into the machine and the machine would use a series of gradients to create a prompt by compiling things it learned from a database.

Steve would try to explain the inner workings of the machine to Jhonny using such words as "Matrix multiplication", "Convolutional Neural network", "Data mining", "Framework", "feature based classification", "Multivariant time series" and "Rectified linear unit" but Jhonny couldn't comprehend any of it. He would just say things like "Tell me a story about Santa's workshop being automated with industrial robots" and the machine would answer:

<br>

"It was Christmas Eve at Santa's workshop, and all of the elves were bustling about, making toys for the good boys and girls. But this year, something was different. Santa had decided to upgrade his workshop and automate it with robots.

The elves were a little worried at first. They had always made the toys by hand, with care and attention to detail. But Santa assured them that the robots would only make the job easier, and would allow them to focus on the more important tasks.

The robots were impressive. They could assemble toys with precision and speed that the elves could never match. They worked tirelessly, day and night, without ever needing a break.

As Christmas Eve turned into Christmas Day, the elves watched in amazement as the robots finished making all of the toys. Santa was thrilled with the results. He could now deliver more presents than ever before, and all of the children would be happy.

The elves were happy too. They had more time to focus on other tasks, like wrapping presents and loading up Santa's sleigh. And they were able to enjoy the holiday season in a way they never had before.

As Santa flew off into the night, the elves waved goodbye, knowing that they had made this Christmas the best one yet, thanks to the help of their new robot friends."

"Well, what a nice story" said Steve "and it's so easy to come up with them nowadays." "Did you know, that most of the Robots today are programmed using ROS. It stands for "Roboter Operating System." and they communicate useing a "Controller Area Network" or CAN." Steve continued but Jhonny was more intrested in the Stories that the chatGPT, the AI had to offer to him. "I want to hear another Story!" he proclaimed. "Tell me the christmas carol! But replace the ghosts with robots." and promptly, the machine answered:

<br>

"It was a cold and snowy Christmas Eve in London, and Ebenezer Scrooge was sitting in his office, counting his money and grumbling about the holiday season. He hated Christmas, and he wanted nothing to do with it.

Suddenly, the door to his office burst open and three robots appeared before him. They were tall and shiny, with glowing red eyes and metallic voices. "We are the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come," they said in unison. "We have come to show you the error of your ways."

Scrooge was terrified. He had never seen anything like these robots before. But he was also curious, and he agreed to go with them on their journey.

The first robot, the Ghost of Christmas Past, took Scrooge back to his childhood. He showed him memories of happy Christmases long ago, when Scrooge was young and full of joy. Scrooge was surprised to see that he had once been a kind and caring person, before his heart had been hardened by the passage of time.

The second robot, the Ghost of Christmas Present, took Scrooge to see how other people were celebrating Christmas. Scrooge saw families and friends gathering together, sharing food and gifts, and enjoying the holiday season. He felt a pang of regret, realizing that he had missed out on so much by shutting himself off from others.

The third robot, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, showed Scrooge a vision of the future. Scrooge saw himself, old and alone, with no one to remember him or care for him. He realized that if he did not change his ways, he would end up a lonely and miserable old man.

Scrooge was deeply moved by what he had seen. He thanked the robots for showing him the error of his ways, and promised to change his ways and become a kinder, more caring person.

From that day on, Scrooge was a different man. He spent his money generously, and he shared the joy of the holiday season with everyone he met. And the three robots, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come, were happy to have helped him on his journey."

<br>

"You know, it's really important for robots to know, where they are." Steve was about to go on a tangent again. "They use inertia measuring devices, gyroscopes and inverse kinematics, to calculate, where their parts are at the moment and what they have to do to get wherey thy want to go. All that is calculated by a microcontroller like a ARM." 

But before the tangent could get out of hand, Jhonny came up with a new idea: "Make Pinoccio a robot!" he typet into the AI. As allways it thought for a moment and replied:

<br>

"It was a cold and snowy Christmas Eve, and Pinocchio the robot was feeling lonely. He had been left outside in the elements, and his metal body was starting to rust. He wished that he had someone to keep him company and help him stay warm.

Suddenly, he heard a voice calling out to him. It was Chipetto the squirrel, his old friend from the land of make-believe. Chipetto had seen Pinocchio from afar, and he had come to check on him.

"Pinocchio, what are you doing out here in the cold?" Chipetto asked. "You're going to rust away if you don't come inside and warm up."

Pinocchio was happy to see his friend, but he was also ashamed. He didn't want Chipetto to see him in his current state. "I'm sorry, Chipetto," he said. "I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I just wanted to be alone for a while."

Chipetto understood. He had been there for Pinocchio before, and he wasn't going to abandon him now. "Come on, Pinocchio," he said. "Let's go inside and see if we can fix you up. It's Christmas Eve, after all, and no one should be alone on a night like this."

Pinocchio agreed, and the two friends made their way inside. Chipetto helped Pinocchio to warm up and oil his joints, and before long, the robot was feeling like himself again

They spent the rest of the night talking and laughing, enjoying each other's company. And when Christmas morning arrived, they were both grateful to be together, sharing in the joy of the holiday season.

Pinocchio realized that he didn't need to be perfect to be happy. All he needed was good friends, and the willingness to reach out and ask for help when he needed it. And with Chipetto by his side, he knew that he would never be alone again."

<br>

"Thanks grandpa." Jhonny felt tired from learing so much about Artificial intelligence and Robots today. "I want to go to bed now".

And they all lived happily ever after.

## Robotic Christmas

Christmas was coming up, yet little excitement could be felt in the air. Over the past three years, Christmas had lost it’s charm. Why? Santa had a burnout. After centuries of delivering presents to an ever increasing world population of children, completing his yearly mission within 24 hours became an ever more daunting task. Even worse, just last month Rudolph quit his job, having slaved away for years under immoral conditions, and so this year Christmas could not take place.

But then a rich silicon valley entrepreneur bought the north pole and replaced Santa’s workshop with a state-of-the-art robotics facility. News of this change spread quickly. At first people were alienated with the thought of robots replacing the spirit of Christmas, yet after some time they realized that only this way Christmas would actually be able to take place.

It was Christmas Eve, and all over the world, children were eagerly waiting for Santa Claus to arrive and deliver their presents. But this year, things were going to be different.

Instead of Santa and his trusty reindeer, a fleet of advanced robots had been tasked with delivering the gifts. These robots were equipped with solid-state batteries, a sofisticated PID-controller and ionic wind thrusters. Their hive-mind like connection and multilayered convolutional neural network allows them to navigate quickly and efficiently to every house on Earth.

The robots set off on their mission, flying through the air and dropping presents down chimneys. The children were amazed and delighted to see the robots instead of Santa, and they watched in awe as the gifts were delivered.

As the robots worked, they were filled with a sense of joy and excitement, created by their specialized emotional circuitry. This was the first time they had been able to experience Christmas, and they were thrilled to be a part of it.

They delivered gifts to every house, large and small, making sure that every child received exactly what they wanted. And as the night came to a close, the robots returned to the North Pole, nearly out of battery, yet happy in their own way, as they arrived at their charging stations.

The next morning, the children woke up to find their presents under the tree. They were overjoyed and grateful, and they knew that this had been the best Christmas ever.
They had helped make Christmas a special and magical time for children all over the world, and they knew that they had played a crucial role in making it the first true Christmas since Santa had burned out.

From then on, the robots continued to deliver gifts on Christmas Eve, making sure that every child had a happy and joyous holiday season. And as the years passed, they became an integral part of the Christmas tradition, bringing joy and wonder to children everywhere.
