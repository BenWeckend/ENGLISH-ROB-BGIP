    A single vulcanic erruption- a multitude of dangers 

    (warning: graphic video at times)

      {{1}}
    Summary: 

      {{1}}
    Volcanoes are unpredictable with the power to execute unimaginable disasters. Despite this, people live in its shadow and benefit from the fertile soil. Volcanoes stand for power as well as life and therefore one quickly forgets the power that rests in them. To educate people, the video presents the biggest dangers of a volcanic eruption.

      {{1}}
    The power of the volcano is not only unpredictable, because of its huge dimensions it’s impossible to control it. One of the most common appearances during a volcanic eruption are ash falls. Before and after an eruption it only takes 40 minutes to bild a 40 km high ash cloud that can travel for 100 km. When the ash comes down it buries everything under meter thick layers. This causes buildings to collapse, power to shut down and farmland to be unusable. Also the ash contaminated water is undrinkable. But when the hot ash flows down the volcano it’s deadlier than the ash cloud. It is faster than 100 km/h and it destroys everything within a radius of 600km. On its way down the ash start big fires and only a few people can survive such a catastrophe.  The ash can be followed by large mud flows that are nearly as destructive as the ash flows. 

      {{1}}
    Before an eruption, magma rises into the vent. But since volcanoes are very porous it can lead to landslides. The problem is, that there are no signs, that show when a landslide will happen, so that they are just as dangerous as avalanches. They can trigger tsunamis that become dangerous for people many kilometers away. Nearly every volcanic eruption results in the formation of one or more lava flows. They form big rivers that can reach a velocity of 30 km/h. Fortunately, the flow rate of the lava flow at the foot of the volcano decreases to 1km/h and people are able to outrun it. The lava masses burn everything in their path and leave the rest under a thick layer of cooled rocks. But the most dangerous are the volcanic gases, because they are not visible. A volcano produces not only water vapors but also carbon dioxide and sulfides. These gases are highly toxic and harm anyone who breathes them.

      {{1}}
    Volcanoes are elemental forces that are both a blessing and a harm to us humans. It only remains to educate people and hopefully prevent many deaths.

    Why China's largest vulcano is so unusual

      {{1}}
    Summary:

      {{1}}
    This video uploaded more than two years ago by Youtube channel Deep Dive, explores what makes Mount Paektu, Chinas largest volcano and one of the largest volcanoes in the world, as unusual as it is. 

      {{1}}
    They lead into the topic by explaining what are the causes and working principles of the volcanoes we see around the globe and then transition into why this fundamental knowledge does in fact not apply to Mount Paektu. The video presents in a very transparent way the steps researchers took to demystify the origin story of this formidable landmark. Additionally their explanation is accompanied by elaborate graphs or stunning photography.

## What happens if a supervolcano blows up?

    What Happens if a Supervolcano Blows Up?

      {{1}}
    summary: 

      {{1}}
    The two main causes of volcanoes are subduction of tectonic plates and mantle plumes. During the former, a plate containing water gets pushed under another one and into the asthenosphere. Since there is very high pressure in those depths, the rock is normally solid, although extremely hot. Now, with water introduced to the system, it causes chemical reactions which allow the rock to melt into magma, despite the pressure. The magma rises to the surface until it breaks through the crust and causes an eruption.

      {{1}}
    The second cause of volcanoes – mantle plumes – happen as follows: There are abnormally hot coulombs of rock that rise from the earth’s core to its surface. When they pierce through the crust, the drastically hot magma gets ejected in the form of a volcano. These volcanoes can happen anywhere, since they are not restrained to the boundaries of tectonic plates.

      {{1}}
    To measure the scale of a volcano, scientists developed the “volcanic explosivity index” (VEI). It measures the volume ejected during an eruption. A volcano assigned to VEI 2 could fill around 400 full olympic swimming pools with lava. A VEI 5 volcano produces an entire lake worth of melted rock. Eruptions with the strength of VEI 6 and higher can cause global wide changes.

      {{1}}
    So called "super eruptions" start at a VEI of 8. There are only a few volcanoes capable of causing such eruptions. It is estimated that these erupt every 17,000 years on average. The chance of such an event taking place in the next 100 years is 2%. And even if it happens, there are precautions like monitoring ground swelling and temperature increases, which will warn us early enough to take necessary measures.

    Lava Returns to Halemaʻumaʻu, one of the largest volcanic lakes on earth

      {{1}}
    summary:

      {{1}}
    No matter how great the danger posed by a volcano is, the cultural significance of some is not to be neglected.

      {{1}}
    The Volcano Kīlauea and its Crater Halema’uma’u are some of the most sacred places on Hawaii,

      {{1}}
    the Crater is said to be the home of Pele, the volcano deity in the islands religion.

      {{1}}
    In modern ages, this cultural significanceis combined with its great characteristics as a natural laboratory cause of its frequent activities, enabling researchers to study the behaviour of the volcano and lava lakes.

      {{1}}
    Compared to the other volcanoes which make up Hawaii,  

      {{1}}
    Kīlauea is the youngest of the five with an age of ~600.000  years. Its frequent activities, during which lava flows cooled on top of each other, enabled it to become a shield vulcano, which today rises up to roughly 4000feet/1220 meters.

      {{1}}
    Starting around the 1820s/'30s, there would a near continous lava lake which lasted around a century.

      {{1}}
    Thomas Jaggar, arriving in 1909, found Kīlauea to be the perfect site for the study of volcanic activity, leading to the creation of the "Hawaiian Volcano Observatory" in 1912, along with the site becoming a national park in 1916.

      {{1}}
    8 years later, a eruption doubled the diameter of Halema'uma'u, spanning over 3000 feet/915 meters.

      {{1}}
    The remaining century would lead to different periods of inactivity and activity lasting up to thirty years, with the latter often showing itself in the form of lava lakes.

      {{1}}
    The first erruption in the 21st century occured on the 19th of march, 2008, with signs indicating that lava was near the surface, with 2015 beeing the year of lava spilling out onto the Halema'uma'u crater.

      {{1}}
    Since then, Researchers use a multitude of tools to create scans of the crater, analyse Ash Particles, vulcanic gas, vog and their content/influence and impact on both the landscape and the citizen of Hawaii.

## The lab where they produce lava flows without the need for volcanoes

    The lab where they produce lava flows without the need for volcanoes

      {{1}}
    The award winning science educator and entertainer Kyle Hill shows the workings of the Syracuse lava lab, one of only two facilities worldwide capable of producing lava flows of significant size for scientific purposes.

      {{1}}
    For a very long time all knowledge about the processes of flowing lava could only be gathered by observing lava in the wild. But expeditions to volcanoes are dangerous and are confined by the conditions at hand. 

      {{1}}
    So a team of scientists around scientist Jeff Carson at Syracuse university in New York State set out to develop ways to produce representative lava flows under predetermined conditions and with reduced safety risks for the observers. 

      {{1}}
    Ancient lava is molten down in two ovens, one large one outside and a smaller one indoors, and then poured onto a sloped surface prepared in different ways. This way the reserchers can observe the impact of different surfaces, water contents, slopes, temperatures and compositions of the substrate on the way the lava flows and its properties after cooling.

## Krakatoa: The first disaster of the modern Era

    Krakatoa: The first Disaster of the Modern Era

      {{1}}
    Summary:

      {{1}}
    The video „Krakatoa: The First Disaster of the Modern Era“ recorded by the Youtube channel „Geographics“ describes the course of the eruption of the volcano Krakatoa and its consequences in several parts.

      {{1}}    
    The first part „Mighty Mountain“ describes the indonesian island Krakatoa.
    Located beween Java and Sumatra, it was formed by volcanic eruptions and consists of three peaks.

      {{1}}    
    The reason for the volcanic activity is the subduction zone between the Indo-Australian plate and the Eurasian plate, so Krakatoa belongs to the „Ring of Fire“.

      {{1}}    
    The volcano wasn't considered dangerous and many even thought it was extinct.
    The eruption itself is desribed in the second Part „The Day the Earth exploded“.

      {{1}}    
    In May 1883, the first signs of volcanic activity were noticed. Ash clouds were witnessed and people heard the sound of distant explosions but they weren't concerned. Over the next two month colonists even went sightseeing and locals celebrated the awakening of the mountain.

      {{1}}    
    But 1pm on August 26th the first explosion took place which was soon followed by more.

      {{1}}    
    The eruption reached its climax at 6am in the next morning with four gigantic blasts.

      {{1}}    
    After 10 am the final, loudest burst occured. Krakatoa went up with over 10 000 times the force of the hiroshima bomb. Debris got hurled up over 80km into the sky and 4 500 people were killed only by pyroclastic flows in a radius of 65km. Ash clouds coverd large parts of Sumatra and Java and chunks of rock rained down on thousands of square kilometres.

      {{1}}    
    The force of the eruption caused the island to collapse into the ocean which resulted in an eruption of steam and a destructive tsunami.

      {{1}}    
    The next part: „The Killer Waves“, deals with this phenomenon.

      {{1}}    
    The start was one big wave that was around 22m high. Most survivors didn't flee after that as they thought the catastrophe was over. Due to that misconception the second wave that was as high as 40m could kill even more peolpe. 

      {{1}}    
    In the end over 300 towns were annihilated and 32 000 people killed in the course of the tsunami.

      {{1}}    
    Its effects could even be felt as far away as Hawaii.

      {{1}}    
    „The Loudest Noise“ is the fourth part and describes the audible airwave caused by the explosion.

      {{1}}    
    The bang of the last eruption holds the record of being the loudest sound ever recorded. It was able to burst the eardrums of people in a distance of 65 km. Barometers all around the world recorded changes in air pressure. At a distance of 160 km the noise was as loud as 172 db which is comparable to a rocket launch. In Alice Springs (Australia) it still sounded like extreme close gunshots. The bang is equivalent to an explosion in Doublin being heard in New York. Ultimately  over ten percent of the human population could heard it. 

      {{1}}    
    Even after being inaudible the sound wave could still be detected. It circled the entire planet four times before disappearing and is called the „great airwave“.

      {{1}}    
    In the last part of the video „A Very modern Disaster“ the social impact of the eruption is explained.

      {{1}}    
    The explosion of Krakatoa was the first truly global disaster. Newly laid undersea telegraph cables spread the news faster then ever before. For the first time people could talk about a gobal katastrophe on the very next day. 
    But even after that the consequences could be felt all around the world. From 1883 to 1884 abnormal athmospheric  phenomena were recorded due to gases that were spewed out. In New York people saw fiery red sunsets and in Norway Edvard Munch witnessed a blood red sky that inspired him to draw his famous painting „The Scream“.

      {{1}}    
    In the end around 36 000 people were killed in the result of the explosion which makes it the second deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history.

    Mount St. Helens: America’s Deadliest Eruption

      {{1}}
    summary:

      {{1}}
    The volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helen on May 18 1980, was the most significant eruption in the USA.

      {{1}}
    Precoursors to this Level 5 eruption started on March 27. When in the following month repeated seismic activity and small volcanic explosions started to occure more often, it was clear that a major explosion was to take place.

      {{1}}
    Surveying the built-up to this event, was volcanologist David A. Johnston working for the USGS (United States Geological Survey). He noted multiple different changes in his time surveying this volcano. The most significant? 
    A buldge on the northern face of the mountain, which protruded over 120m and grew  by more than 1.5 meters a day at times. When on May 18 a magnitude 5.1 earthquake shook the ground, this buldge collapsed and turned into the biggest landslide in recorded history. Covering an area of 62 square kilometers. This release of pressure caused the magma and ash to shoot out of the side and top of Mount St. Helen.

      {{1}}
    Traveling with almost supersonic speed, this blast covered an area of roughly 600 square kilometers and reached a height of 19 km. This cloud of ash traveled 100s of kilometers and caused major blackouts, engine failures  and respiration problems.

      {{1}}
    In total this explosion cost 1 billion $ (not adjusted for inflation)in damages, 57 lifes, major ecological damages and a political backlash.

      {{1}}
    If Govenor Dixy Lee Ray would have expanded the red zone, suggested by the USGS and other sources, 54 lifes could have been saved, 54 people thinking they were save outside the designated danger zone.

    Yellowstone Volcano Is Waking Up And Just CRACKED Open The Earth!

      {{1}}
    summary:

      {{1}}
    The video is about the risk that comes from super volcanos. 

      {{1}}
    It begins with a warning that we shouldn’t only watching after Asteroids in the sky but should watch over volcanos more than before. Then they name the problems that are coming with an outburst of a super volcano, like hunger, war and temperature decrease.

      {{1}}
    After this they begin with an eruption from over 640 000 years in the Yellowstone Park and talking about the reasons why the ground is moving up- and downwards. In this part of the video are some fragments of the video cut out, so it is a bit confusing. The super volcano in Yellowstone Park is suggested not more likely to explode.

    Then they use the activity of the geyser in Norris Basin to show that the situation in Yellowstone can be shifted in maybe an unexpected short time. To show make this position clearer they show some data about the latest enormous uplift of the ground in Norris Basin.

      {{1}}
    Then they argue what the chances for an explosion of the super volcano are. For this are the earth quakes und the ground movement used. But is very hard to predict the activities because of the missing data. An expectation can be made by using the distant past, so there was every 600 000 to 800 000 years an eruption of the super volcano.

      {{1}}
    After this the deconstructive power of an eruption and of a lava flow is told. The Eruption would be much more powerful than the lava flow. The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory tell that it is more likely that a lava flow or hydrothermal explosions happen and compared the chances for an eruption are very low. And the chances for lava flows is very low.

    For an active volcan is the Taup volcano in New Seeland, which´s volcanic alert level raised from 0 to 1 on September 20th, given.

    The video ends with the conclusion that an eruption of a super volcano would impact us more than we can think of and we should research in this topic because of its enormous impact, even it has only a low chance to happen.

    summary:
    The video is about the risk that comes from super volcanos. 
    It begins with a warning that we shouldn’t only watching after Asteroids in the sky but should watch over volcanos more than before. Then they name the problems that are coming with an outburst of a super volcano, like hunger, war and temperature decrease. After this they begin with an eruption from over 640 000 years in the Yellowstone Park and talking about the reasons why the ground is moving up- and downwards.

    Dante's Volcano

      {{1}}
    Summary:

      {{1}}
    This NASA video is about a robot called Dante 2, which is able to lower itself into the crater of an active volcano to make measurements there.

      {{1}}
    It was build by a team of scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and was sponsored by the NASA, as they themselves expected to gain knowledge about how robots on future extraplanetary mission can move autonomous.

      {{1}}
    In the beginning of this video they explain the mission it was built for an then show some field test.

      {{1}}
    During these tests you can easily see how the robot operates. It has eight legs, which are arranged in a way, that the center piece of the robot with the inner four legs can slide in between the outer ones to move forward.

      {{1}}
    To control the robot they have developed several, for 2011 advanced, systems. There are three main way in which they can let it move, the first two relay on the satellite communication with the 80 miles away control room in Anchorage.

      {{1}}
    The first one seems kind of a classic way of operations, as the see all parameters an then are able to move each joint parametric, the second way is more advanced, as here the are using two cameras to broadcast an videofeed which than can be seen in a VR­-headset.

      {{1}}
    If they switch on the most advanced option they don’t even need to directly control it any more, as this system is AI based and so is able to operate autonomous.

      {{1}}
    They were able so successfully use this system on the first half of the descend into Mount Spurr in Alaska.

    Vulcane 101 is a short educational video from National Geographics that looks at the geophenomenon of volcanoes. The video starts with the different types of volcanoes that exist in numerous forms on land and underwater.

      {{1}}
    There are Stratovolcanoes (tall cone shaped
    Shield Volcanoes (flatt and dome shaped), depressions in the ground) and Mid ocean Ridges (underwater chains of volcanic mountains).

    Because despite the great danger, volcanoes provide more
    land area and nutrient-rich soil.

## The most dangerous type of eruptions - Flood volcanism explained

    The Most Dangerous Type of Eruptions - Flood Volcanism explained

      {{1}}
    The video from “Facts in motion” deals with one of the most dangerous volcanic eruptions to ever exist.

      {{1}}
    In addition to classic and well-known eruptions, such as those in Krakatau or the super volcano in the Yellowstone national park, this type of volcanic eruption is different.

      {{1}}
    The flood basalt eruptions not only have a short-term effect on the immediate environment, but also change the entire life on this planet, even more than super volcanoes do.

      {{1}}
    To describe what happened, the video takes you back to a time when the primeval continent Pangea still existed. Back then, in the area of todays Siberia, plumes formed below the earth’s crust, which melted huge amounts of rock. As a result, large parts of the land area were continuously flooded by molten basalt over several thousand years.

      {{1}}
    In total up to four million cubic kilometers of basaltic lava were released during this event. Due to the lava layer , which pressed on the surface, the magma could not rise up, which is why an underground network formed and heated up an enormous area of continental crust and set free gases from the rock.

      {{1}}
    In the process, immense amounts of gas were released to the surface and led to several chain reactions on earth, which resulted in life-threatening circumstances, as they, for example, destroyed the ozone layer.

      {{1}}
    Within a few thousand years the global animal population had decreased by more than 99,9% due to the changes that were caused. Overall, this type of volcanic eruption led to an evolutionary reset from wich the earth had to recover for millions of years.

## Earth's most destructive supervolcanoes

    Earth's Most Destructive SuperVolcanoes

      {{1}}
    This is a Video about the most destructive super volcanoes in the history of earth and how they changed the face of the earth. It is about the estimated scale of the eruptions of such super vulcanoes and the comparison of recent events.

      {{1}}
    It is said, that yellowstone is one of the largest activ vulcanoes and the last it blew, it sent an estimated 1000 km^3^ of materials into the atmosphere. Compared to more recent events the eruption of Mount Saint Helens, in the year 1980, just blew 2.79 km^3^ of ash and other materials into the atmosphere. Two other eruptions mentioned are Mount Pinatubo in 1991 who blew 10 km^3^ of materials and a vulcano twice that size on the Indonesian Island of Krakatoa in 1883. The Video mentions it unleashed the equivalent of 10,000 Hiroshima bombs. (this would mean about 130.000 kiloton of TNT or 130 megaton of TNT which would be round about 540 petajules of energy; the strongest man-made bomb, the thermonuclear bomb known as tsar bomb, has a tested strenght of 50-56 megatons of TNT and a thertical yield of 100 megaton of TNT).

      {{1}}
    But not only the energy of such eruptions is critical, but also materials blown into the atmosphere. Recorded photos aboard a space shuttle show the sulfurous haze from Mt. Pinatubo, which was able to block enough sunlight to lower global temperature by abouth half a degree Celsius.

      {{1}}
    At this time experts began modeling climate changes of such disruptions and estimated a limited nuclear war between two countries with about 100 hiroshima sized bombs to lower the temperature by about 1.2 degrees celsius for two to three years. Those effects are small compared to what would happen if the yellowstone vulcano would erupt, like it did roughly 640.000 years ago. In the model using high powered computer 18 months after eruption the temperature would fall to the lowest by 10 degrees celsius and would gradually recover over the course of two decades. Even bigger super volcanoes would lead to more catastrophic wheather.

      {{1}}
    Those vulcanoes are able to not only destroy the climate as we know it but alter the face of the earth and could lead to a nearly inhabitable planet.
